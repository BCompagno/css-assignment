## Task 1: Targeting Elements by Tag Name + Border
- Select all 'p' tags and change the font-size to 16px
- Finally, add a border around all p elements with a 1px solid line of any color you choose

## Task 2: Targeting Elements by Class + Padding
- Find the 'nav' element in index.html
- Give it a class (make sure it is descriptive and easy to understand)
- Below this comment, target the class you just made and give it a pretty background color
- Give it 20px of padding - note that the background color 'grows' around the text

## Task 3: Targeting Elements by ID + Margin
- Take a look at the input element with id="name" in index.html
- Below this comment, target that element by its ID and give it a border radius of 2em
- Finally, add 15px of margin to the bottom of that element. Note that it pushes the other inputs down

## Task 4: Targeting Elements by Descendant Selectors
- Take a look at the structure of the unordered list in the <nav> element
- Below this comment, target all <a> tags that are inside of <li> tags and give them text-decoration: none and a new color of your choice (this will make them look less like hyperlinks)
